COVID_19 Tracker

In this application, we use React and a custom hook to access our API.
This is rendered onto the GUI as cards that display the amounts of infected individuals, those recovering, and the amount of deaths; this is all based on 
the location which can be selected in the drop down menu. There is also a component  that renders this data on a line chart.
